I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher** in the Division of Transport Planning, Department of Civil and Architectural Engineering, at **KTH Royal Institute of Technology**, Sweden.  

I am an **AI-driven urban mobility researcher** with expertise in autonomous driving management, synthetic data generation, and privacy-preserving mobility analytics. My work sits at the intersection of **transport planning and management, machine learning, and urban behavioural analysis**, and I have research and professional experience spanning **China, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Europe**.
