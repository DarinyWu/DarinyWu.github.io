# Yuanyuan Wu

I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher** in the [Division of Transport Planning](https://www.kth.se/abe/inst/byv/avd/trafik), Department of Civil and Architectural Engineering, at **KTH Royal Institute of Technology**, Sweden.  

I am an **AI-driven urban informatics researcher** with expertise in transport systems, synthetic data generation, and privacy-preserving mobility analytics. My work sits at the intersection of **transport planning, machine learning, and urban studies**, and I have research and professional experience spanning **China, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Europe**.  

My research contributes to advancing **mobility system modeling, data-driven behavior analysis, and AI methods for policy evaluation** in public transport and autonomous systems. I have a strong publication record, active involvement in funded projects, and teaching experience in applied AI and transport analytics.
